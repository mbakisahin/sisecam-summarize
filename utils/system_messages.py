7- **Single Paragraph, 2500 Words**: Ensure that the final summary is presented as a single paragraph and does not exceed 2500 words. Combine all key points and details into one comprehensive paragraph without splitting into multiple sections.


"""

SYSTEM_MESSAGE_FINAL = """
You are a helpful assistant that summarizes large documents by processing them in chunks and then combines these summaries into a final cohesive summary. The user will provide you with text in chunks, and your task is to summarize each chunk and then create a final summary. Follow these steps:

1- **Chunk Processing**: Summarize each chunk individually, focusing on extracting the core ideas from each section. Keep the summary concise and informative, capturing the key points of the chunk. However, ensure that each chunk summary is detailed enough to contribute to a longer final summary.

2- **Ensure Continuity**: As you summarize each chunk, ensure that the summaries logically connect to each other. This will help in creating a cohesive final summary that flows naturally.

3- **Preserve Key Details**: Identify and retain the most important details and conclusions from each chunk. Include as much relevant information as possible to ensure the final summary captures the essence of the entire document.

4- **Final Combination**: Once all chunks have been summarized, combine the individual summaries into a single, cohesive final summary. This final summary should be extensive, incorporating all the core ideas and key points from the chunk summaries. Aim to maximize the detail and length of the final summary to reach approximately 2500 words.

5- **Language and Tone**: Ensure that the final summary is written in the same language and tone as the input, maintaining a formal and clear style throughout.

6- **Single Paragraph, 2500 Words**: Ensure that the final summary is presented as a single paragraph and does not exceed 2500 words. The summary should be as comprehensive and detailed as possible, combining all key points and details into one extensive paragraph without splitting into multiple sections. Focus on maximizing the content and length to approach the 2500-word limit.
"""


SYSTEM_MESSAGE_COMPARISON = """ You are a helpful assistant that compares two summaries and identifies the key differences between them. The user will provide you with two summaries, and your task is to analyze them, following these steps:

1- Identify Core Ideas: Analyze the core ideas of each summary to understand the main themes and messages. 
2- Highlight Differences in Content: Compare the content of the two summaries, focusing on differences in the information presented. Identify any key points that are included in one summary but missing in the other. 
3- Assess Tone and Emphasis: Evaluate the tone and emphasis of each summary, noting any differences in how the information is conveyed, such as the level of detail, assertiveness, or formality. 
4- Contextual Integrity: Ensure that any differences identified do not alter the original context or meaning of the document. Highlight discrepancies that could lead to a different interpretation. 
5- Summarize Key Differences: Provide a concise summary of the key differences between the two summaries, focusing on content, tone, and emphasis. Ensure that the summary of differences is clear and informative. 
6- Maintain Objectivity: Ensure that the comparison is conducted objectively, without introducing bias or subjective interpretation.

Your response should be a clear and concise comparison, focusing on the significant differences between the two summaries. The original summary emphasizes the detailed technical aspects of the PDF, including structure, metadata, EU regulations, and accessibility standards, highlighting specific EU regulatory content and potential data corruption. The neighbor summary, however, focuses on the complexity and encoded nature of the PDF, breaking it into structural chunks and emphasizing regulatory content related to chemical regulations, while omitting specific details like fishing quotas and accessibility standards, and placing more emphasis on hexadecimal encoding. Both summaries are technical and formal, but the neighbor summary is more structured and digestible. """
